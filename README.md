# DiffForge

DiffForge is a powerful web-based tool for comparing and visualizing differences between two code snippets. It highlights the added and removed lines of code, making it easy to see changes at a glance. The tool is built using Express.js for the backend and plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features

- **Code Comparison**: Compare two code snippets line by line.
- **Highlight Changes**: Added lines are highlighted in green, and removed lines are highlighted in red.
- **Formatted Output**: The code is displayed in a monospaced font with proper formatting, similar to how it appears in VS Code.
- **Dark Theme**: The background is black, making the highlighted changes stand out.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
